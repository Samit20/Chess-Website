            Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by
            two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces of
            contrasting colours [white and black].
          </h5>
          <p class="text-muted text-left">
            Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century AD and by the
            10th century had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe.
            Since at least the 15th century, chess has been known as the “royal
            game” because of its popularity among the nobility. Rules and set
            design slowly evolved until both reached today’s standard in the
            early 19th century. Once an intellectual diversion favoured by the
            upper classes, chess went through an explosive growth in interest
            during the 20th century as professional and state-sponsored players
            competed for an officially recognized world championship title and
            increasingly lucrative tournament prizes. Organized chess
            tournaments, postal correspondence games, and Internet chess now
            attract men, women, and children around the world.

            The first 10 moves of game 16 were identical to those from game 12.
            Karpov was the first to deviate, but Kasparov had analysed the
            position deeply in his preparation before the match, and was able to
            take the initiative, despite playing with the black pieces.
            <br />
            On move 16, he succeeds in planting a knight on d3, dominating
            Karpov's position. Move by move, Kasparov gradually restricts his
            great opponent, bringing him in the middlegame to virtual zugzwang,
            quite an achievement with so many pieces on the board. On move 34,
            to get rid of the terrible knight, Karpov is forced to give up his
            queen for three minor pieces — not a terrible exchange in strictly
            material terms, except that Black now played 37...Rc1, and after 38
            Nb2 Qf2 39 Nd2 Rxd1+ 40 Nxd1 Re1+ Karpov resigned because of 41 Nf1

                Chess24 was born in the Hamburg Chess Club when Grandmaster Jan
                Gustafsson pitched the idea of a small chess video website to
                Enrique Guzman, the co-founder of a successful education
                company. Enrique, who credits chess with giving him the ability
                to think in a structured and strategic manner, was happy to give
                something back to the chess world, but on one condition - that
                they would set about building the world's best all-around chess
                website.
                <br />
                <br />
                Chess24 launched in 2014 with offices in Hamburg and Gibraltar
                and has grown into the best destination for watching top chess
                tournaments and enjoying the highest quality chess content
                online. Play Magnus, an Oslo-based company backed by World Chess
                Champion Magnus Carlsen, also launched in 2014, and in March
                2019 the two companies combined forces. Play Magnus brings
                expertise in mobile apps and education along with the direct
                involvement of arguably the greatest chess player of all time.
                The goal remains to deliver the world’s best chess experience.

                In 2010, Thibault Duplessis began work on Lichess as a hobby
                project. The site was simple at the beginning, not even checking
                to see if moves were legal. He made the site open source, which
                means anyone is free to read the source code and make
                contributions. Gradually, the site improved and collected users
                as an enthusiastic volunteer staff assembled to help Thibault
                build and maintain the site. Today, Lichess users play more than
                five million games every day.
                <br />
                <br />
                Lichess is one of the most popular chess websites in the world
                while remaining 100% free. Most “free” websites subsist by
                selling ads or selling user data. Others do it by putting all
                the good stuff behind paywalls. Lichess does none of these
                things and never will. With no investors demanding profits,
                Lichess staff can focus on improving the site as their only
                goal.

His precocious skills inspired the Academy Award-nominated movie, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993).
